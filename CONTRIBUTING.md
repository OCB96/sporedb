## How to contribute to SporeDB?

This project is at a very early stage, don't expect the contributing process to be too twisted ;)

* Issues are a very good starting point: it shall represent the current work in progress at a given point in time, and work to be done;
* Do not hesitate to submit Merge Requests for features proposal, and issues for bug reports;
* **Vulnerability disclosures can be submitted with private issues on Gitlab.com**

**Important note:** the whole development process is being done on Gitlab.com.
The Github.com repository shall only be used as a read-only mirror.
